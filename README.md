## General Info
This application is meant to aid its users in creating simple, consistent, and professional ReadMe files for their applications and projects. 
Using NodeJS and the command line interface, this application uses the inquirer package to obtain user-entered information.
Using this same information, the application takes and structures the information into a ReadMe markdown file which will be easy
to add to an existing project.

## Next Steps

- Update the application to hide any sections of the ReadMe that are not used or specificed in the markdown file.
- Possible restructuring of the ReadMe template.
